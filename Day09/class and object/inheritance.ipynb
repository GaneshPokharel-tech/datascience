    "## Inheritance in Python\n",
    "Inheritance is one of the key features of object-oriented programming. It allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting all of the attributes and methods of the parent class. This enables code reuse, making it easier to write and maintain complex programs. The parent class is also called the base class, while the new class is called the derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a powerful tool that can greatly simplify code development and maintenance. By reusing existing code and building on top of it, we can avoid duplicating effort and create more complex and powerful programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of inheritance, including single inheritance, multiple inheritance, multi-level inheritance, hierarchical inheritance, and hybrid inheritance. Let's discuss each of them independently."

    "## 1. Single Inheritance\n",
    "Single inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming where a class (child or derived class) inherits properties and methods from another class (parent or base class). The derived class inherits all the attributes of the base class, and it can also add its own attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a single inheritance relationship in Python, you define the derived class and the base class, and then use the syntax\n",
    "\n",
